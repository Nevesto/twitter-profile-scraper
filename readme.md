# Twitter profile scraper

This is a simple twitter tool to scrap images from a twitter profile. I created this to study and personal use.

</br>

## Use yarn or npm to install the libs

</br>

# How to use:

Comment all the code after ```print('Bot iniciado.');``` and log in twitter. After this you can use as normally.
